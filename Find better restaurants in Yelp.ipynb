    "1) Your businese problem to solve:\n",
    " \n",
    "**Currently, Yelp didn't provide clear recommendation for its users, thus we'd like to clarify the recommendation function of restaurants for consumers' information, which may improve their user experience on Yelp.**\n",
    " \n",

    " \n",
    "2) Why the problem is important to solve?\n",
    " \n",
    "**As we've mentioned above, currently what Yelp provides is the \"recommend reviews\", which can reflect how the restaurants are like objectively, however, we believe it is a little pity that Yelp doesn't provide clear recommendation of restaurants. The reasons are kinds of obvious: firstly, consumers tend to use Yelp when they have no idea for food or even they are in a hurry to find where to have a good meal; consequently, they are likely to feel content if they can have more direct answers/ recommendation of restaurant from Yelp. What's more, for the new starters, such convenient recommendation function will probably help them integrate into the Yelp user community more easily, thus raising users' activeness and viscosity for the website, bringing more profit in other words.**\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "3) How could you provide a better solution with data science.\n",
    " \n",
    "**By collecting the data of Yelp, from business to users and reviews, which all contain several specific and important items, like star, location, user basic information and vote type, we integrate them into a whole data frame that enables us to fulfill our business idea of recommendation of restaurants. With the help of several useful packages in Python concerning statistical methods like normalization, PCA and SVM, we build our algorithms, test and come to the final product for our recommended restaurants for each users in a chosen state.**\n",
